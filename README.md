# D3-Green CPU

Welcome to **Silicon Sprint**, a National-Level 24-hour hackathon. This Problem Statement aims to design and implement a custom 16-bit Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) and its corresponding processor using Verilog HDL.

Starting from a basic single-cycle core, the design evolves into a fully pipelined processor featuring an IEEE 754 compliant half-precision Floating-Point Unit (FPU) and a custom cryptographic co-processor. This repository showcases our journey through defining a custom ISA, handling pipeline hazards, and integrating specialized hardware accelerators under tight time constraints.
