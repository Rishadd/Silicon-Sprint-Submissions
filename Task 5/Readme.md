# Insructions
---

Refer to the boiler plate for the crypto co-processor from the [Resources-Crypto Boiler Plate](https://github.com/Rishadd/Silicon-Sprint-D3-Green-CPU/tree/main/Resources/Rtl/crypto_coproc.v).
The encryption algorithm is already written. You mus identify it and correctly write the algorithm for decryption.
Once that's done, interface it with the pipelined_core and test it with the mentioned instructions.
Your final submissions must be **ONE SINGLE MODULE** named as `pipelined_core_crypto.v` as given in this dirrectory. All required modules must be instantiated within this module itself. 

*crypto boiler plate will be added soon*
